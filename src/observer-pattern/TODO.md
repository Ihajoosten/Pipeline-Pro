# TODO List

1. Define the Subject interface to declare methods that can be used by the concrete subjects to manage the list of observers and to notify them of changes.

2. Implement the Subject interface in the BacklogItem, Pipeline, Sprint, and Thread classes.

3. Define the Observer interface to declare the method that the subscribers implement to receive updates from the subjects.

4. Implement the Observer interface in the BacklogItem, Pipeline, Sprint, and Thread classes to allow them to receive updates.

5. When a change occurs, notify the subscribers by calling their update() method.

# Summary

- The Observer design pattern allows objects to subscribe to changes in the state of other objects, known as the subject. In this case, the backlog item, pipeline, sprint, and thread classes are the subjects, and the subscribers are the observers.

- To implement the Observer design pattern, you need to define an interface for the subject and the observer. The subject interface should have methods for adding and removing observers, as well as notifying them of changes. The observer interface should declare a method for receiving updates from the subject.

- The BacklogItem, Pipeline, Sprint, and Thread classes should implement the subject interface to manage their list of subscribers and notify them of any changes. They should also implement the observer interface to receive updates from other subjects.

- When a change occurs in the subject, the subscribers should be notified by calling their update() method, passing in any necessary information about the change. This allows the subscribers to react to the change and update their own state if necessary.
