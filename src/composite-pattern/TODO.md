# TODO List

1. Define the Component interface with the accept method that takes a Visitor object.

2. Create the Pipeline class that implements the Component interface and contains a list of Action objects.

3. Create the Action class that also implements the Component interface and has a type property to distinguish between different actions.

4. Implement the accept method for the Pipeline class that calls the accept method on each Action object in the list.

5. Create the Visitor interface with visitPipeline and visitAction methods.

6. Create the RunVisitor class that implements the Visitor interface and defines each visit method for different types of Action.

7. Implement the accept method for the Action class that calls the appropriate visit method on the given Visitor object.

# Summary

The composite pattern is used to create a hierarchical structure of Pipeline and Action objects, where Pipeline objects can contain multiple Action objects as children. The visitor pattern is then used to perform operations on the Pipeline and Action objects without modifying their structure. A Visitor object is passed to the accept method of a Pipeline or Action object, which then calls the appropriate visit method on the Visitor object. The Pipeline class contains a list of Action objects, and its accept method calls the accept method on each Action object in the list. The Action class has a type property to distinguish between different types of actions, and its accept method calls the appropriate visit method on the given Visitor object. The RunVisitor class implements the Visitor interface and defines each visit method for different types of Action, allowing you to perform different operations on each type of action.
